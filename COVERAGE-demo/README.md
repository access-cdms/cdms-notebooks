# Matchup JSON output for COVERAGE demo notebook

This notebook is designed to be run on either a local or remote instance of SDAP. 

NOTE: If running on local, please ensure you are running a version that supports CAML output. One can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/RKuttruff/incubator-sdap-nexus) in the `coverage-json` branch.
